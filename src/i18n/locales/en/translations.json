			"* Counter. Binds to website. Some service policies require you to change your password once a month, a year and so on. As we've said earlier at Getpass the same input produces the same output. So we implemented a counter variable. Just increase it when you need to change your password without altering website name or changing the secret keyword. This is stored locally like options above.",
			"* Scrypt parameters. Binds to entire application (i.e. affects everything). Well, you must know what you are doing if you decided to change them. Changing them may not only increase or decrease a complexity, but directly affect password generation time.

			"First of all, Getpass (every platform or service implementation) doesn’t use ANY of your data. Not a single POST request to the hosting or arbitrary server is done.

			"Secondly, there is a small difference between how the local version (mobile, desktop, browser extension) and service version (website getpass.io) treat your data:",
			"* Service version doesn't store anything at all, but at the same time it doesn't provide some of the local version features. Main use case for the service version: one-time password generation or when you do not have access to any of your local app version.",
			"* Local version stores locally login and website list (and all the preferences). We insist that login and website are not sensitive pieces of information and could be obtained easily (most of the time it is your phone number or mail address that are used as login, but you can use whatever you want inside this app). The reason that we store this is to give our users better experience when they need to generate a password – just 4 single taps to select login and website. This convenience does not reduce users safety, because, we give users the ability to obscure these values and / or you may use your own way to alias these pieces of data (for example, you may use “git repos” instead of “github” or “google mail” instead of ”gmail”)",

			"Secret keyword is **never** stored anywhere. That is a crucial piece of information and as it’s title says, you must keep it as private as possible",

			"This is one of the cases where you can use a Counter parameter by increasing its value from the default “0”. Remember that leaked password (even if the attacker somehow managed to find that you are using Getpass with specific Login and Website) does not mean that your Secret Keyword was leaked too. It is practically impossible to brute force it based on the obtained information.",
			"",
			"The other way to overcome this issue (can't say this is an elegant way) is to alter/change your website name: for example, use 'gmail_new', 'gmail_after-hacked', 'gmail.com' if your previous website value was 'gmail'."
